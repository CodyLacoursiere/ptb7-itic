    "Right now, the PTB7 workspace directory has 441 different folders (jobs/simulations/statepoints) with more coming.  \n",

    "There are small systems, medium systems, large systems, 5mers, 10mers, 15mers, tons of different densities and temperatures, quenched simulations (basically meaning we start the sim at the goal temperature) and annealed simulations (run lots of simulations while slowly lowering the temperature).  These are the parameters we can choose from when telling signac to search the workspace and only find the jobs we want.\n",
    "\n",
    "Right now, we are working with quenched simulations of small systems, so these two parameters will be sort of \"hard-coded\" into our signac process for now.  The varialbe parameters we will change are going to be the polymer length (5mer, 10mer, 15mer).  For example, we want to tell signac to return only small, quenched 5mer systems, and run those jobs through whatever process (finding slops of MSDs), then we'll change 5mer to 10mer and run the same process (and again with 15mer).\n",
